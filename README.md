# Microcontroller_Fun_Projects
This repository consists of projects which I have done in my spare time. I am using a Arduino Uno Microcontroller with other eletrical components to simulate small projects. Some projects contained are:
1. LED_ON_AND_OFF 
2. Potentiometer_Reading
3. Face_Detection_Program
## LED_ON_OFF
Flashing the LED found at pin 13 using Python, Arduino IDE and a Arduino UNO microcontroller. This project was done using the tutorials on OpenCV.
## Potentiometer_Reading
A potentiometers output ADC values are read using Python, Arduino IDE and a Arduino UNO microcontroller. It is then shown visually on a image by changing the dimensions of a elipse. This project was done using the tutorials on OpenCV.
