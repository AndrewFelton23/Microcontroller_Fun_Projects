# Microcontroller_Fun_Projects
This repository consists of projects which I have done in my spare time. I am using a Arduino Uno Microcontroller with other eletrical components to simulate small projects. Some projects contained are:
1. LED_ON_AND_OFF 
2. Potentiometer_Reading
3. Face_Detection_Program
## Potentiometer_Reading
Flashing the LED found at pin 13 using PyCharm IDE and a Arduino UNO microcontroller. This project was done using the tutorials on OpenCV.
